Full Script: 
Introduction
0:00
A shepherd boy forgotten by his own
0:03
father, overlooked by a prophet, yet
0:06
chosen by God. This is the story of
0:10
David, the boy who ran toward [music] a
0:13
giant when an entire army ran away. But
0:17
this story is not just about one battle.
0:20
It's about a king consumed by jealousy
0:23
who hunted the very man who served him.
0:27
It's about a prince who gave up his
0:29
throne for friendship. It's about spears
0:32
thrown, secret escapes through windows,
0:36
and a farewell between two friends who
0:38
would never meet again in peace. You
0:41
will witness David spare the life of the
0:44
man who wanted him dead and weep over
0:47
his grave when he fell. You will see how
0:50
a boy anointed in secret waited more
0:52
than a decade before he wore the crown.
0:55
Stay with us until the end because this
0:59
story will teach you how [music] to face
1:00
your giants, how to wait for God's
1:03
timing when everything seems lost, and
1:05
why true power is not proven by what you
1:08
take, but by what you refuse to take.

1:29
Now, let's begin.
Chapter 1: The Forgotten Son
1:33
Israel had its first king, but he would
1:36
not last.
1:38
God had [music] chosen Saul, but Saul
1:41
disobeyed again and again. So God
1:44
decided to replace him. He told the
1:47
prophet Samuel to go to Bethlehem to the
1:49
house of a man named Jesse. Among his
1:52
sons, the next [music] king was waiting.
1:55
But Samuel hesitated.
1:58
If Saul finds out, he will be furious.
2:04
God told him to keep the mission secret.
2:07
Go to Bethlehem.
2:08
Gather Jesse's [music] family. No one
2:11
must know the real reason.
2:13
Samuel obeyed. When he arrived, Jesse
2:17
brought his sons before the prophet. The
2:19
eldest came first, Elap, tall and
2:22
strong. Samuel thought, surely this is
2:25
the one. [gasps and sighs]
2:26
But God [music] stopped him.
2:29
Not this one. You see his appearance. I
2:33
see his heart. Then came Abinadab.
2:35
[music]
2:37
God said no. Then Shama again. No. One
2:42
by one, the remaining sons passed before
2:45
[music] Samuel. Seven sons. Seven times
2:49
God looked at their hearts and seven
2:51
times he rejected them.
2:55
Are these all your sons?
2:58
There is still the youngest [music]
3:00
Mayv out tending the sheep.
3:03
The youngest, so overlooked that his own
3:06
father had not [music] bothered to bring
3:08
him.
3:09
Samuel insisted,
3:11
"Bring him." They brought the [music]
3:14
boy in. His name was David. Young,
3:17
ruddy, the last anyone expected. He
3:20
looked [music] nothing like a king.
3:24
But God spoke. [groaning]
3:26
This is the one.
3:29
Samuel poured oil over David's head
3:31
while his brothers watched. The spirit
3:34
of the Lord rushed [music] upon him and
3:36
remained from that day forward. No one
3:39
announced it to the nation. No one
3:41
could. This anointing was a secret. and
3:44
David simply returned to his sheep,
3:47
carrying a promise only God could see.
Chapter 2: The Giant's Challenge
3:51
Years passed. David grew stronger in the
3:54
fields, tending his father's sheep. When
3:58
lions or bears came for the flock, he
4:00
fought them. Each battle shaped him.
4:03
Each victory deepened his faith.
4:06
Meanwhile, [music] Israel faced a new
4:09
threat.
4:10
The Philistines gathered for war and
4:13
camped on one hill. Saul and the men of
4:16
Israel camped on the opposite hill.
4:19
Between them lay the valley of Aah. From
4:22
the Philistine camp emerged a champion
4:24
named Goliath. He stood over 9 ft tall,
4:29
covered in bronze armor with [music] a
4:31
spear as thick as a wooden beam.
4:35
Choose a man to fight me. If he wins, we
4:39
will be your servants. But if I win, you
4:43
will serve us. I defy the armies of
4:47
Israel. Vath. [music]
4:49
Send me a man.
4:52
40 days he issued this challenge. 40
4:55
days. No one answered. Not even Saul.
4:59
And back in Bethlehem, a shepherd boy
5:02
had no idea that God was about to call
5:04
him to the battlefield.
Chapter 3: The Shepherd Arrives
5:07
One day, David's father sent him on an
5:10
errand.
5:12
Take this bread and grain to your
5:14
brothers at the camp. See how they are
5:16
doing and bring back news.
5:20
David left the sheep with a keeper and
5:22
set out early the next morning. He
5:24
arrived just as both armies were taking
5:27
their positions, shouting battle cries
5:30
[music] across the valley. David left
5:32
the supplies with an officer and ran to
5:35
find his [music] brothers.
5:36
As he was greeting them, Goliath stepped
5:39
out from the Philistine lines and roared
5:42
his [music] usual challenge.
5:44
David watched the soldiers of Israel
5:46
turn and flee. But he did not run. He
5:50
stood and listened as Goliath [music]
5:52
mocked the army of God.
5:55
The men around him whispered [music]
5:57
about the reward. Whoever kills the
5:59
giant would receive riches, the king's
6:02
daughter in marriage, and his family
6:04
[music] would never pay taxes again.
6:07
David's heart burned.
6:10
Not for the reward,
6:12
for the honor of God.
6:16
Who is this Philistine that he dares to
6:18
defy the armies of the living God?
6:22
Eliabad, his eldest brother, overheard
6:25
him, and his anger grew.
6:28
Why did you come here? Who is watching
6:30
those few sheep? I know your arrogance.
6:33
You just [music] came to watch the
6:35
battle. David turned away and kept
6:38
asking his question to others.
6:41
Soon, word of his boldness [music]
6:43
reached the king.
6:45
Saul sent for him. When David stood
6:49
before the throne, he [music] spoke
6:51
without hesitation.
6:54
Let no one lose heart because of this
6:56
giant.
6:57
I will go and fight him.
Chapter 4: Five Smooth Stones
7:01
Saul looked at David and shook his head.
7:04
You cannot fight this Philistine. You
7:07
are only a boy. He has been a warrior
7:10
since his youth.
7:12
But David stood firm. M
7:15
he told Saul how he had killed a lion
7:18
and a bear with his own hands while
7:21
protecting his father's [music] sheep.
7:23
The same God who delivered him then
7:25
would deliver him now.
7:28
Saul studied [music] the boy's face.
7:31
There was no fear in his eyes.
7:34
Go and the Lord be with you.
7:40
Saul dressed David in his own armor. But
7:43
the king was the tallest man in Israel,
7:46
and David was [music] still young.
7:49
The helmet covered his eyes. The coat of
7:52
male [music] dragged him down. He could
7:55
barely walk. He stopped.
7:59
I cannot fight with these.
8:02
I have not tested them.
8:05
He removed the armor. all of it.
8:09
Instead, David picked up his shepherd's
8:12
staff. He walked to the brook that ran
8:15
through the [music] valley and knelt
8:16
down. From the water, he chose five
8:20
smooth stones and dropped them into his
8:22
shepherd's bag. Then he took his sling
8:25
in hand and walked toward the giant.
Chapter 5: The Giant Falls
8:31
Goliath saw [music] David coming and
8:33
laughed.
8:35
Am I a dog that you come at me with a
8:39
stick?
8:43
Come here. I will feed your flesh to the
8:47
birds [music] and the beasts.
8:52
David did not flinch.
8:59
You come to me with sword [music] and
9:00
spear, but I come to you in the name of
9:03
the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies
9:06
of Israel, whom you have defied. This
9:10
day, the Lord will deliver you into my
9:13
hand."
9:15
Goliath moved forward. The ground shook
9:18
beneath his steps, but David did not
9:21
retreat. He ran straight toward the
9:24
giant. He reached into [music] his bag,
9:27
pulled out a stone, loaded his sling,
9:30
and released it. The stone flew. It
9:33
struck Goliath in the forehead, and sank
9:36
deep. The giant's eyes went wide, his
9:39
massive body swayed, and he crashed face
9:43
first into the dirt. The valley fell
9:46
silent.
9:48
David ran to the fallen giant, drew
9:51
Goliath's own sword, and finished him.
9:55
When the Philistines saw their champion
9:57
[music] was dead, panic swept through
9:59
their ranks. They turned and ran.
10:04
The men of Israel, the same men who had
10:06
trembled [music] for 40 days, rose up
10:09
with a shout and chased them all the way
10:11
to the gates of their cities.
10:14
The impossible [music]
10:15
had happened. A shepherd boy had
10:18
defeated the giant, but David knew the
10:21
truth. It was not his victory. It was
10:24
the Lord's.
Chapter 6: A Song and a Friendship
10:29
When the battle was over, Abnner, the
10:32
commander of Saul's army, brought David
10:35
before the king. David still held the
10:38
head of Goliath in his hand.
10:41
David,
10:42
Jesse's son.
10:44
You have done what no man in Israel
10:47
could do.
10:53
The Lord delivered him into my hand.
10:57
Jonathan, the king's son, stood nearby.
11:01
He had watched this shepherd defy a
11:03
giant [music] in the name of God. And as
11:06
David spoke, something took hold of
11:09
Jonathan's heart. He felt bound to
11:12
David, not as a rival, but as a brother.
11:17
He loved him as his own life.
11:20
They made a covenant that day, a bond
11:23
deeper than blood, stronger [music] than
11:25
ambition. Then Jonathan did something
11:28
remarkable. He removed [music] his own
11:30
robe and placed it on David's shoulders.
11:33
He handed him his armor, his sword, his
11:36
bow, his belt, everything that marked
11:39
him as the crown prince.
11:42
It was an act of surrender. Jonathan,
11:46
the rightful heir, was saying without
11:48
words,
11:50
"You are the [music] one God has
11:52
chosen."
11:54
When the army returned, women poured out
11:57
of every city to meet them, dancing,
11:59
singing, playing tambourines.
12:02
Their voices rang through the streets.
12:05
Saul has slain his thousands, and David
12:07
is 10 [music] thousands.
12:10
Saul heard it, his face darkened.
12:14
They give David 10 thousands and me only
12:17
thousands.
12:19
What more can he have but the kingdom?
12:22
From that day on, Saul watched David
12:25
with jealous eyes. The spirit of the
12:28
Lord had departed from him, and a darker
12:31
spirit now stirred within.
12:34
David remained in Saul's service. He
12:37
went wherever the king sent him and
12:39
succeeded in every mission. Saul placed
12:42
him over the men of war. The people
12:44
loved him. The soldiers respected him.
12:48
Even Saul's servants approved.
12:51
But none of that softened the king's
12:53
heart. The man who once welcomed [music]
12:55
David now saw him as a threat.
Chapter 7: The Spear in the Night
13:00
Jealousy was not the only thing [music]
13:02
troubling Saul. A tormenting spirit had
13:05
taken hold of him. Dark moods that left
13:08
him [music] raving in his own house.
13:11
One day, as David played the harp to
13:13
soothe him, Saul sat [music] with a
13:16
spear in his hand. The music that once
13:19
brought him peace now stirred something
13:21
darker. Without warning, he hurled the
13:24
spear [music] across the room.
13:28
David saw it coming. He dodged and the
13:32
[music] spear struck the wall behind
13:33
him. It was not the last time. Twice
13:37
Saul tried to pinch David to the wall
13:39
with his spear. [music] Twice David
13:41
escaped.
13:44
David looked [music] at Saul and saw the
13:46
truth. He would never be safe here
13:49
again.
13:51
Saul sent [music] men to surround
13:52
David's house. They would strike him
13:55
down by mourning. But Mikall, David's
13:58
wife, and Saul's own daughter,
14:00
discovered the plan. She came to [music]
14:03
David in the darkness.
14:06
If you do not escape tonight, tomorrow
14:09
you will be gone [music] forever.
14:12
Michael lowered David through a window
14:14
and he escaped.
14:16
David fled first to the prophet Samuel
14:19
and told him [music] everything, but he
14:21
could not leave without seeing Jonathan.
14:24
The two friends met in secret. David
14:27
[music] told Jonathan that Saul was
14:29
determined to kill him, but Jonathan
14:31
could not believe it. His father [music]
14:34
had never spoken of such a thing to him.
14:38
Whatever you need, I [music] will do it
14:40
for you.
14:43
So, they devised a plan.
14:46
David would not appear at [music] the
14:47
king's table for the new moon feast. His
14:50
empty seat would force Saul to reveal
14:52
his true intentions.
14:55
When Saul noticed David's [music]
14:57
absence, Jonathan made an excuse for
14:59
him. And Saul's rage exploded.
15:04
"You son of a perverse woman. Do you
15:07
think I do not know that you have chosen
15:09
Jesse's son over your own kingdom? As
15:13
long as he lives, you will never be
15:15
king. Bring him to me. He must die."
15:20
Jonathan pleaded for David's [music]
15:22
life. Saul hurled his spear at his own
15:25
son. Now Jonathan knew the truth. His
15:29
father's [music] rage was murder, fixed
15:32
and final.
15:35
The next morning, Jonathan [music] went
15:37
to the field where David was hiding. He
15:40
brought a young servant to gather
15:42
arrows.
15:43
Jonathan shot an arrow beyond the boy
15:45
and called out, "The arrow is beyond
15:48
you. Hurry, do not delay."
15:51
The servant knew nothing, but David,
15:54
hidden nearby, understood it was the
15:57
signal. He must flee.
16:00
When they were alone, David came out.
16:02
The two men embraced and wept.
16:06
Go in peace. The Lord will be between me
16:09
and you and between my children and your
16:12
children forever.
16:14
They kissed each other and said goodbye.
16:17
David disappeared into the wilderness.
16:20
He would not see Jonathan again for a
16:22
long time and never again in peace.
Chapter 8: The Hunted
16:27
David lived in the wilderness, hiding in
16:30
caves, gathering a band of men who
16:33
followed him, always moving. Saul
16:36
pursued him relentlessly. [music]
16:38
One day, Saul took 3,000 soldiers to the
16:42
wilderness of Engi. Near the sheepfolds
16:45
along the road, there was a cave.
16:49
Saul went inside alone, not knowing that
16:52
David and his men were hidden in the
16:54
back of that very cave.
16:58
David's [music] men whispered urgently,
17:01
"This is the day the Lord has delivered
17:03
your enemy into your hands."
17:06
David crept forward in the shadows. He
17:09
drew his blade, but instead of striking
17:12
Saul, he quietly [music] cut off a
17:14
corner of the king's robe. Immediately
17:17
his heart troubled him.
17:20
The Lord forbid that I should raise my
17:22
hand against him.
17:24
He is the Lord's [music] anointed.
17:27
He held his men back. They did not touch
17:30
Saul.
17:32
When Saul left the cave, David stepped
17:35
outside [music] and called after him.
17:41
My lord, the king.
17:48
Saul turned. David bowed low, then held
17:52
up the piece of robe for Saul to see. He
17:55
told the king that the Lord had
17:56
delivered him into his hand that very
17:59
day. Yet he had spared him. The torn
18:02
[music] robe was proof. David could have
18:05
harmed him, but he did not.
18:10
There is no evil in my heart toward you,
18:13
yet you hunt me.
18:18
Saul wept.
18:21
You are more righteous than I.
18:24
I know now that you will surely be king.
18:28
But David did [music] not return with
18:30
Saul. He and his men went back to their
18:33
stronghold, and the chase continued.
Chapter 9: The King Falls
18:38
The Philistines [music]
18:40
gathered for war. The armies clashed on
18:42
Mount Gilboa and Israel was overwhelmed.
18:46
Men fled and fell across the mountain.
18:49
The Philistines pressed hard after Saul
18:52
and his sons. Jonathan fell. Abinadab
18:56
fell. Malesu fell.
19:01
Then the archers found Saul. Their
19:04
arrows struck him and he was badly
19:07
wounded.
19:09
Surrounded [music] and failing, Saul
19:11
turned to his armor bearer.
19:14
Draw your sword.
19:17
Do not let these men take me alive.
19:21
But the armor bearer was terrified. He
19:24
would not do it. So Saul took his own
19:26
sword and fell upon it. When the armor
19:29
[music] bearer saw that the king was
19:31
gone, he did the same.
19:34
Saul, his three sons, and his men all
19:37
died that day. The next morning, the
19:40
Philistines [music] found Saul's body on
19:43
the mountain. They dishonored it and put
19:46
it on display for all to see.
19:50
But the men [music] of Jabesh Gilead
19:52
remembered how Saul had once delivered
19:54
them. They traveled through the night,
19:57
took down the bodies of Saul and his
19:59
sons, burned them, and [music] buried
20:01
their bones.
20:04
When word reached David at Zlag, he tore
20:08
his clothes and wept. He mourned for
20:11
Saul. He mourned for Jonathan, his
20:14
brother, his friend. And he sang a
20:16
lament that would be remembered [music]
20:18
for generations.
20:28
The beauty of Israel [singing]

Chapter 10: The Shepherd Becomes King
21:28
After the death of Saul, David inquired
21:30
of the Lord,
21:34
"Shall I go up to one of the cities of
21:36
Judah?
21:38
Go up to Hebron."
21:42
So David went with his wives, his men,
21:45
and [music] their families. And there
21:48
the men of Judah came and anointed him
21:50
king over their tribe. But the nation
21:53
was divided.
21:56
Saul had one surviving son, Ishbett, and
22:00
he ruled the northern tribes. For seven
22:03
years, there was conflict in the land.
22:06
David grew stronger while the house of
22:08
Saul grew weaker.
22:12
Then the elders of all Israel came to
22:15
David at Hebron.
22:18
They remembered [music] how he had led
22:19
them in battle, even when Saul was king.
22:23
They remembered what the Lord had
22:24
spoken. You shall shepherd my people
22:27
Israel and be ruler over them. And there
22:31
before the Lord, they anointed [music]
22:33
David king over all Israel. He had
22:37
waited for more than a decade since
22:39
[music] Samuel first poured oil on his
22:41
head in his father's house.
22:45
David reigned 40 years. He governed
22:48
[music] Jerusalem and made it his city.
22:50
He brought the ark of God into its
22:53
walls. He defeated every enemy who rose
22:55
[music] against him. And the Lord was
22:58
with him. The shepherd boy had become
23:01
the king. The promise given [music] in
23:03
Bethlehem had come to pass.
Outro
23:08
What can we learn from this ancient
23:09
story? From David, we learn that God
23:13
sees what others overlook. He was the
23:16
youngest, so forgotten [music] that his
23:19
own father left him in the fields. No
23:22
one thought to bring [music] him before
23:23
the prophet. But God does not measure
23:26
worth by appearance or age. He looks at
23:29
the heart. When the world [music] counts
23:31
you out, remember you may be exactly the
23:34
one God is preparing. From the battle,
23:37
[music] we learn that faith is not the
23:39
absence of giants. It is the courage to
23:42
face them.
23:44
David did not pretend Goliath was small.
23:47
He simply believed that God was bigger.
23:50
He ran toward what everyone else ran
23:52
from. When life places an impossible
23:55
challenge before you, do not wait for
23:58
the [music] fear to leave. Move forward
24:00
anyway. Faith is proven in motion.
24:06
From Jonathan, we learn that true
24:08
friendship surrenders [music] what it
24:10
could claim. He was the crown prince.
24:13
The throne was his by right. Yet when he
24:16
saw God's hand on David, he gave away
24:20
his robe, his armor, his future. Real
24:23
love does not compete. It celebrates
24:26
[music] another's calling even at
24:28
personal cost.
24:31
From Saul, we learn the danger of a
24:33
jealous heart. He began with blessing
24:36
but ended in ruin. jealousy blinded him
24:40
to the very man who served him
24:42
faithfully.
24:43
When we resent another's success, we
24:46
become prisoners of our own bitterness.
24:50
And from David's restraint in the cave,
24:52
we learn that power is not proven
24:54
[music] by what we take, but by what we
24:57
refuse to take. He could have killed
24:59
[music] Saul. His men urged him to do
25:02
it, but David would not raise his hand
25:05
against [music] the Lord's anointed.
25:07
True strength knows when to hold back.
25:11
This is a story of a shepherd who became
25:14
a king not by seizing power, but by
25:18
trusting God's timing through years of
25:20
waiting, running, [music] and hiding. It
25:24
reminds us that the path to purpose is
25:27
rarely straight. But every lion fought
25:30
in the fields, every stone chosen from
25:33
the brook, every moment of faithfulness
25:35
in obscurity,
25:37
it all [music] matters.
25:39
God is writing a story with your life.
25:43
Trust him [music] with the chapters you
25:45
do not yet understand.
